`quick-oxibooks` is a Rust library for interacting with the QuickBooks Online (QBO) API. It provides a high-level, type-safe, and async-first interface for managing accounting data, including invoices, customers, payments, and more. Built on top of the `quickbooks-types` crate, it simplifies integration with QuickBooks while maintaining full control over API interactions.

## Features

- **Full QuickBooks API Coverage**: Supports all major QuickBooks entities and operations.
- **Async-First**: Built with `async`/`await` for seamless integration into async Rust applications.
- **Type-Safe**: Strongly-typed API responses and requests to prevent runtime errors.
- **Authentication**: Handles OAuth2 authentication and token management.
- **Batch Processing**: Supports batch operations for efficient bulk data handling.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types for API, authentication, and validation errors.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable for custom integrations and use cases.
- **Logging**: Built-in logging for debugging and monitoring API interactions.

## Installation

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
quick-oxibooks = "0.1.0"
```

Optional features can be enabled:

```toml
[dependencies]

```

### Optional Features

- **pdf**: Enables PDF generation and retrieval for supported entities (e.g., invoices, estimates).
